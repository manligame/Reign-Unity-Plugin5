	<h1>Android build steps</h1>
	<b>Step 1</b><br />
	<pre>
First set one of these compiler directives (Scripting Define Symbols) in Unity's PlayerSettings.
Make sure to set the correct one for your target store.
GOOGLEPLAY
AMAZON
SAMSUNG
	</pre>

	<b>Step 2</b><br />
	<pre>
Now go to the file menu "File->Build Settings".
In the popup window switch your platform to Android and click the checkbox "Google Android Project" so its on.
Then build your project and after done the Reign plugin will automaticly run a post-build step to generate the Android Studio proj for you.

NOTE: You can do builds without out doing a "Google Android Project" for testing your game but the plugin will NOT work!
	</pre>

	<b>Step 3</b><br />
	<pre>
In the location you built your Android project you will see two folders.
One folder will be the name of your project which is what Unity builds out.
The second folder will be the name of your project but with and extra qualifier of "GooglePlay", "Amazon" or "Samsung".
Open that second folder with "Android Studio".
	</pre>

	<b>Step 4</b><br />
	<pre>
Once the project is loaded in Android Studio click on the left tab labeled "project".
Then expand "app->manifiests" and double-click on the "AndroidManifiest.xml".
Now we need to add the wanted manifiest options referenced in the files under: "{your-unity-proj}/Assets/Plugins/Android/...".
They are:
  AndroidManifest_Base = Needed attribuites for all Reign plugin features.
  AndroidManifest_GooglePlay, AndroidManifest_Amazon and AndroidManifest_Samsung = For platform specific features.

Merge any wanted or needed attribuites in those files into your AndroidManafies.xml located in your Android Studio project.
After this is done copy the "AndroidManfiest.xml" file into your Unity project folder "Assets/Plugins/Android/..." so you don't have to do this again in the future.
